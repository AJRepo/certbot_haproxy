# Script to be called after a successful certbot renewal. Currently
# does nothing except send an email notification. Future work is to
# modify .pem files for HaProxy & restart if pre-checks are all ok.

#Assumptions:
#   HAPROXY pem files are stored in /etc/ssl/$TLSNAME/$TLSNAME.pem
#
#Additionally certbot will pass relevant environment variables to some hooks
#  not to all hooks: https://github.com/certbot/certbot/issues/6722
#  Documentation states the following are sent to RENEW hooks
#    CERTBOT_DOMAIN: The domain being authenticated
#    CERTBOT_VALIDATION: The validation string
#    CERTBOT_TOKEN: Resource name part of the HTTP-01 challenge (HTTP-01 only)
#    CERTBOT_REMAINING_CHALLENGES: Number of challenges remaining after the current challenge
#    CERTBOT_ALL_DOMAINS: A comma-separated list of all domains challenged for the current certificate
#  Confirmed DEPLOY Hook Variables
#    RENEWED_LINEAGE
#    RENEWED_DOMAINS (note: could be wildcard. E.g. *.domainname ) 
#  Varables that are NOT passed to deploy hooks
#    CERTBOT_CERT_PATH
#    CERTBOT_KEY_PATH
#    CERTBOT_ALL_DOMAINS
#    CERTBOT_DOMAIN
